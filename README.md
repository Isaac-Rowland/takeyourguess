# Guess that theme song

Would you like to join in on the fun [Click here](https://takeyourguess.vercel.app/)

This is a game built using react, where a user guesses a famous theme song within a time constraint. 

## Tech stack

- Youtube API v3
- Youtube IFrame API
- React Hooks
- SASS
- CSS animations


## Difficulties 

- Tried working with the Spotify API but there were too many constraints and it could use the infomation coming from it. 

- Youtube API as a max limit of 100 calls a day as default. 


## Features to add in the future 

- Dropdown for the guess list 

- Game history (using cookies or a database) 

- Point system to VS your friends 

- Reccomend your own favourite theme songs to then be added in

- A like button on the current theme songs to see if users like it. Remove the least liked after a set amount of time.
